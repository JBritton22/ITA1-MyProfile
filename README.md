Personal Information

I grew up in a variety of rural country towns in Victoria, Australia after moving around a lot. I finished year 12 at Maffra Secondary College, whilst undergoing and completing a Cert II in Electrotechnology for the final 2 years of high school. Things I would do in my free time consisted of a LOT of video games but also Music once I found that to be a big passion of mine. Currently that is what I do, I am a recording Artist working independently from my home studio. I do all my work with music production on a computer with a Digital Audio Workstation program called Ableton, making most if not all my passions revolve around Technology.
