<p class="d" style="color:white;">I grew up in a variety of rural country towns in Victoria, Australia after moving around a lot. I finished year 12 at Maffra Secondary College, whilst undergoing and completing a Cert II in Electrotechnology for the final 2 years of high school. Things I would do in my free time consisted of a LOT of video games but also Music once I found that to be a big passion of mine. Currently that is what I do, I am a recording Artist working independently from my home studio. I do all my work with music production on a computer with a Digital Audio Workstation program called Ableton, making most if not all my passions revolve around Technology.</p>

<h1 style="color:Khaki;">My Interest in IT</h1>
<h2 style="color:DarkCyan;font-size:25px;">When did it start?</h2>
<p class="d" style="color:white;">My interest in technology started as soon as I was introduced to a gaming console and first mobile phone. Though it was already impossible to separate me from those devices once I figured them out, my interest grew greatly once I was gifted a low-grade custom-built PC. Wanting to know more and how to upgrade PC’s, I took a dive into the “unknowing” (at the time) world of PC parts and upgrading them, which opened a whole new passion.</p>
<h2 style="color:DarkCyan;font-size:25px;">What do you expect to learn from your studies?</h2>
<p class="d" style="color:white;">Deciding to step back and consider what kind of legitimate career I would like to build and what my passions are, I jumped for it. With a little scrolling through Open Universities Australia, I found many options to study online with many different Universities. After considering a few different courses and units that appealed to me I finally decided to enrol in Intro to Information Technology with RMIT. It did not take long to see and feel how convenient studying with RMIT online is, with everything you need to learn accessible at your fingertips.</p>

<h1 style=color:khaki;">Ideal Job</h1>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:30px;">Hardware Tech</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51710107?ref=saved" target="_blank" title="IT Tech Support SEEK.com" style="color:khaki;">IT hardware Tech Support</a></p>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">Why Hardware Tech?</h2>
<p class="d">Being very interested in computer and tech hardware firstly, the hands-on, fully detailed opportunities always stand out the most when I am researching IT careers. Troubleshooting and repairing tech appliances or software appeals to me mostly in these roles, as resolving issues or malfunctions with devices and applications provides me with a great sense of accomplishment.</p>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">Knowledge Required?</h2>
<p class="d">Upon researching hardware tech jobs, I found that the general qualification benchmark or requirement is any post-secondary certificate or degree in Information Technology. The skills needed in this area of work consist of troubleshooting, critical thinking, communication and the ability to think outside the box. A very sought-after strength when considering someone for employment is always experience, even more so in areas dealing with tech. Viewing a handful of different adverts for hardware roles, exposure or knowledge in areas related to Computers & Electronics, Troubleshooting Software & Tools, and familiarity with new and emerging Technologies are all basic examples of experience required for the job.</p>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">What knowledge & skills do I possess?</h2>
<p class="d">During my final 2 years of high school while studying VCAL, I completed a course in Electrotechnology. Most of the work during the course were theory units, but there was still a lot of practical work and assessments which were more based around wiring and switchboards. On the computer tech side of things, it is more self-taught knowledge than anything, having just one form of tech repair work experience with an actual company under my belt. I have had troubles and resolved many with all my PC’s and even other appliances over the time I have been using them, so that is something. I can recall many times when I have grown frustrated or even made the problem worse by getting frustrated, but there are more times where I have persisted and came out the other end with the problem solved.</p>
</p>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">If I were to list my top 3 strengths they would be</h2>
<ul style="color:khaki;">
 <li>Troubleshooting</li>
 <li>Persistence</li>
 <li>Problem Solving</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">A plan</h2>
<p class="d">The journey to gain what I need is probably what haunts me the most, I know there is A LOT out there and I am more than excited to go get it. Understanding, acknowledging and accepting my flaws or weaknesses has been new to me and trying to work on them has always been outside my comfort zone, but seeing how progression worked with my music stuff, it is comforting to know practice and some patience will make perfect. That is what I am intending to do, get myself into a relevant role(s) inside the industry to expand on what is needed to advance to where I want to be.</p>

<h1 style="color:khaki;">Personal Profile</h1>
<p class="d">After completing the Myers-Briggs personality, learning style and creativity tests online, I was able to discover and narrow down certain parts of myself I did not know so much about before-hand, with more insight on how to better develop myself in a career working amongst others. In conclusion to all 3 tests,I am a 60% Visual learner with a very introverted, intuitive personality.</p> 
<img src="16Personalities-Personality Type.jpg" alt="PersonalityTest" style="width:20vw;height:45vw;"> <img src="creativity test.jpg" alt="CreativityTest" style="width:50vw;height:40vw;"> <img src="learning style test results.jpg" alt="LearningStyleTest" style="width:25vw;height:15vw;"> 
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">What do the results mean?</h2>
<p class="d">With the results of these tests, I can be aware of certain weaknesses or strengths that might need addressing when forming a team or trying to communicate problems within groups. Knowing more about your own personality, learning style and how you process information in general is very helpful, especially when confronting others with issues or frustrations. Being turbulent could cause a lot of unneeded stress and acting from feeling more than 5thought would only promote that landslide downwards. But knowing that now even if it is not 100% true is greatly beneficial to myself and any other of my potential group members as I can be aware of my instinct and make sure that I approach all aspects of groupwork with care and consideration.</p>

<h1 style="color:khaki;">Project Idea</h1>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">Overview</h2>
<p class="d">While there are many voice communication apps or software’s available across platforms like smartphones and computers. Used for connecting and communicating whether it is with friends and family for more social utilisation, or work colleagues and teammates for work-related and teamwork matters. There are no real established cross-platform communication applications available to all gamers from different consoles or devices, nowhere for users or players from all sides of the table, of different console types, for example, (PC, Xbox, PS, etc.)</p>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">Motivation</h2>
<p class="d">As of lately there has been a lot of new “cross-platform” video games being introduced, for example “Fortnite, Among Us, COD”. Almost all multiplayer games are having to make their franchises cross-platform to cater to everyone and their differences in what devices they choose to play on, everyone has their own preference. In saying that a multi-platform communication app downloadable and usable the same way from every device screams convenience. No more having to use a separate device while playing your Xbox, or whatever it be, just to talk to your friend who is using another platform like PlayStation. In-game chat channels are usually available in cross-platform games to patch this topic up, but a common point of weakness always spoken of amongst users is the latency within online games, making in-game comms channels unreliable.</p>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">Description</h2>
<p class="d">Features in an app like this would need to appeal to new users, forcing them to let go of past comms set-ups they have had to use. The ability to log-in with credentials you are already familiar and registered with would be necessary, like Microsoft, Sony or google accounts, multiple logs in options are a must for ease of use. Design side of things I would consider the application running off a server concept, with an option to open/create servers or channels and invite friends or other users of the app from any device. With other apps out there in mind I like to think simplicity plays an important role, and with that in mind including only what is needed and desired from users would be priority. All gamers are looking for in communication apps is ease of use and smooth interfaces, nothing too confusing or time consuming, after all the game being played is the main experience, the communications is just the sauce that helps make the experience better when you are playing with others. Screen streaming or sharing has gone through my thoughts a few times while brainstorming, being a cool idea for explaining or assisting friends you are playing with, thinking about it more there is not much out there like that now in terms of an application for console users.</p>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">Tools & Technologies</h2>
<p class="d">In terms of what is needed to commit to something like this I am still learning, researching I can see it is a lot of programming with coding like HTML and CSS and a handful of other languages I am still not so familiar with.</p> 
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">Skills Required</h2> 
<p class="d">There is a huge list of skills required for the job, coding, programming, patience being a few right off the top. Being familiar and good at HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a requirement. From all the research I have done on building apps it is a lot if not mostly writing code, requiring quite a vast span of knowledge in it. Creating a successful app like the one I have described would take some patience, especially when starting at ground zero, although I would not say its fully unattainable. Enrolling and completing educational units relating to the task at hand would not hurt and only help better the knowledge currently obtained.</p>
<h2 style="color:darkcyan;font-size:25px;">Outcome</h2>
<p class="d">Upon completion of the project I would assume a better means of communication while playing multiplayer video games, helping improve and expand on the world of cross-platform gaming especially. Having one landing place accessible to all gamers to communicate with one another as they please would be a great improvement or addition to the online gaming world.</p>
